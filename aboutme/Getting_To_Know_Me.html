    <p> What is up everyone! I am excited to be in this web class this year. My degree is in professional studies and I am loving it. I love to do anything outside with my family. We love to hike, go swimming, play sports, honestly anything we can do. I am married and we have a little girl. My current job is I am a teacher at a local high school. The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the environment I love the people and the standards of BYU-Idaho. I have always wanted to learn how to do web designing and now this is my chance and I am excited for what I am going to learn. </p>
    <p> I grew up in the church and served a mission in New York. One of my favorite quotes is when President Nelson taught us to "Think Celestial" for someone who struggles with patience and not seeing the big picture, that really stuck out to me.</p>
