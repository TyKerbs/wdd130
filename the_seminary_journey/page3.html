                <p> Someting you are asked to do everyday is speak in front of a group of people. This is hard and takes a lot of time and practice to master. Seminary teaching provides thousands of opportunities to stand up and speak in front of a crowd. This is a skill that seminary teachers are able to master over time. </p>

            <h1> Learning how to work with others </h1>
            <div>
                <p> Teamwork is crucial to becoming a successful seminary teacher. You need to learn how to work with coworkers, students, parents, priesthood leaders, and local high schools. This is tough and similar to public speaking takes some practice in order to master, but over time people do learn to master it. This is a skill that isn't realized but achieved by seminary teachers. </p>
