                <h1> Choose to Deepen your Relationship </h1>
                    <p> Choosing to deepend your relationship with Jesus Christ is a choice. We know that our ultimate goal is to live with our Heavenly Father again and we can only do that through the covenants we make in the temple. We've seen the purpose for teaching seminary and as we make sure we are focused on the purpose, then we will consequently make changes in our lives to deepend our relationship with Jesus Christ. </p>

                <h4> Eternal Families</h4>
                <p> We need to have our sights on what matters and that is living with our families forever. We need to prepare ourselves for this true possibility so that we can teach the students in a way that conencts them to Him. Having this as a focus will help deepen a relationship with Jesus Christ. </p>
