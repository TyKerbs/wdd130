                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p> The purpose of being a seminary teacher is to "help youth and young adults deepen their conversion to Jesus Christ and His restored gospel, qualify for the blessings of the temple, and prepare themselves, their families, and others for eternal life with their Father in Heaven." This comes from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and is exactly what the purpose is for seminary teachers.</p>

                <h3>Expectation</h3>
                <p> There are many expectations that a teacher can have. They can range anywhere from how the students should act, how a teacher wants their classroom to be set up, or even the culture of the classroom. However, the most important expectation is that the teacher is focused on Jesus Christ, teaching the doctrine, and invite diligent learning amongs the students.</p>
