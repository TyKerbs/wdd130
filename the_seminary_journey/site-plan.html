      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
       I want my pages to focus on the benefits of teaching seminary. This page is focused on the purpose of teaching seminary. There will be the seminary objective posted here as well as what is expected of a teacher. People will come wanting to know what seminary teachin is all about. They will have their questions answer such as "What does it look like to be a seminary teacher" or "What is expected of me if I want to be a seminary teacher". This will be their first and brief experience about what seminary is all about. The images selected aren't going to be actual pictures of teaching but the focus of what you are suppose to teach. There will be a picture of someone reading scriputes and of someone raising this hand. This is to show as a seminary teacher you are expected to strengthen your own person testimony and also strive to help others build their own. The two child pages will be about "Deepening your relationship with Jesus Christ" and the second page will be "Developing life long work skills".

      </ul>
      <h3>"Deepening your relationship with Jesus Christ"</h3>
      <p>
        This section is focusing on how becoming a seminary helps someone deepening their relationship with Jesus Christ. This tends to be an obvious assumption given the purpose of this job is to help others come unto Christ. However, it is possible to be a seminary teacher and not have a relationship with Jesus Christ. It all comes down to the dedication a teacher has to put in the work outside of the classroom. There time set aside during work to study and prepare lessons to help inspire youth and this is valuable time for a teacher to deepen their relationship. There also is a standard that seminary teachers are living a life that they are constantly building this relationship with Christ even outside of work. Having a perosnal study, building a Christ centered home, going to the temple, and these are just a few examples of what a seminary can do to keep strengtheing their relationship with Christ. Not only is this a beneift of being a seminary teahcer but it also is an expectation in order to be affective teacher. I am going to use a picture of prayer and a temple to show the importance and benefit of building a relationship with Christ.

      <h3>"Developing life long work skills"</h3>
      <p>
        Deepening your relationship with Jesus Christ is obvious and might be the main factor for why people want to become a seminary teacher, however there are other life skills that you learn that will have a positive impact in your life. One is the ability to connect with others. Youth are incredible and are so fun to work with, but they also come with challengs. It is a skill to be able to listen and understand youth in a way that a teacher can appy a teaching in the scriptures to them. It is a skill to be able to listen and help the student feel like someone cares and is there for them. It is a skill to be able to approach someone and find ways to connect and get them to open up. There are also skills in being able to public speak. You are expected to public speak everyday and make it engaging everytime. There is also not much time to get everything you need done so time management is a huge skill that you learn. You also need to be able to work with your faculty in order to be successful in the classroom. Here are just a few but I want the audience to walk away knowing that being a seminary teacher, even if they don't want to do it for their whole life, can bless them with skills that will be a benefit to them their entire life. So I will be using pictures of someone public speaking as well as someone talking to someone one on one. This is to just show the different areas of connecting with others that seminary teaching can help with as an example.
